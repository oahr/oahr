# Frequently Asked Questions

> Is this an official ID?

**Yes!** The Manufacturer ID is officially registered with Hyperion. Your individual Product ID is assigned to you by us, and valid for a lifetime.

> Can I have multiple Product IDs for the same project?

Sure, if multiple Product IDs are technically required. You can also request further Product IDs later, if you extend your project and need more.

However, please abstain from reserving Product IDs "just in case". There is no need to do so.

> Can I ask for a specific Product ID?

Sure, if it is still free. We reserve the right to give you another product ID though.

> What parts of the project must be open?

Everything that is required for anyone to build and run a working copy of your hardware. This is (not limited):

* Circuit diagrams
* Gerber files (to order the PCB at a PCB manufacturer)
* JEDEC files for programming the CPLDs, PALs, etc.
* Firmwares (e.g. EPROM, EEPROM, Flash ROM)
* Amiga drivers (if necessary)

> Can I still earn money with my project?

Of course! You can sell the complete hardware, construction kits, and PCBs. You can also ask for donations. The only strict requirement is that anyone who is willing and able to build and run the hardware, can do so for free.

> I want to sell one part of the hardware or software. Can I still have a Product ID.

**No.** We're sorry, but this project is dedicated to promote Amiga hardware that is fully open. We can understand that you would like to have a financial compensation for the time you have invested in the project. However, for projects with a commercial aspect, it is still possible to quote an own Manufacturer ID from Hyperion.
