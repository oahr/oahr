# Frequently Asked Questions

## Open Hardware

> What parts of the project must be open?

Everything that is required for anyone to build and run a working copy of your hardware. This is (not limited):

* Circuit diagrams
* Gerber files (to order the PCB at a PCB manufacturer)
* JEDEC files for programming the CPLDs, PALs, etc.
* Firmwares (e.g. EPROM, EEPROM, Flash ROM)
* Amiga drivers (if necessary)

In other words: If your hardware cannot be built without having to buy components or software exclusively from you, you are not eligible for this repository.

> Can I still earn money with my project?

Of course! You can sell the complete hardware, construction kits, and PCBs. You can also ask for donations.

The only strict requirement is that anyone who is willing and able to build and run the hardware, can do so for free.

> I want to sell one part of the hardware or software. Can I still have a Product ID.

No. We're sorry, but this project is dedicated to promote Amiga hardware that is fully open. We can understand that you would like to have a financial compensation for the time you have invested in the project. However, for projects with a commercial aspect, it is still possible to quote an own Manufacturer ID from Hyperion.

## Manufacturer/Product ID

> Is this an official ID?

**Yes!** The Manufacturer ID is officially registered with Hyperion. Your individual Product ID is assigned to you by us, and is valid for a lifetime.

> Can I ask for a specific Product ID?

Sure, unless it is already taken. We reserve the right to give you another Product ID though.

> Can I have multiple Product IDs for the same project?

Sure, if multiple Product IDs are technically required. You can also request further Product IDs later, if you extend your project and need more.

However, you cannot reserving Product IDs "just in case", since we request to see the photo of a prototype. But there is also no need to do so, since it is easy to get more Product IDs as soon as you need them.

## Forks etc

> I have made a fork of an open Amiga hardware project. Can I get my own Product ID.

If it is just a fork, then no. You can still use the original product ID.

If your fork has evolved, and there are major changes to the original project that justify an own product ID, you can apply for one. Example: You forked an USB expansion, and added a SCSI host adapter to it.

> I want to continue developing on my project as closed source.

You can do so if your license permits it.

However, your Product ID was assigned to the **open** version of your project. If you close it, you must register your own Manufacturer ID with Hyperion for the closed version.
