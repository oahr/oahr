Thank you for creating an open hardware, and for doing your part to keep the Amiga community alive!

Please describe your project. We will provide your product ID(s) as soon as we accept your application.

# My Project

* Project Name:
* Name of the maker or the team:
* URL of the source code:
* Open Source License:

All fields are required.

Also, please attach a photo of your hardware to this issue, or provide a link to a photo. This is meant as a proof that you have reached prototype stage. It must be an actual photo, not a 3D rendered image!

# Product IDs

Please fill out for _every_ product ID you need.

* Desired Product ID (optional, if available, otherwise assigned by us)
* General purpose of that ID (e.g. RAM expansion, hardware registers, USB connector)
* Are serial numbers used? If yes, what do they represent? (e.g. random number, always 0, Git commit hash)

Please refrain from reserving product IDs for future use! Only apply for product IDs that you actually need for your project.
