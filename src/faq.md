# Frequently Asked Questions

## Open Hardware

**What parts of the project must be open?**

> Everything that is required for anyone to build and run a working copy of your hardware. This is (not limited):
> 
> * Circuit diagrams
> * Gerber files (to order the PCB at a PCB manufacturer)
> * JEDEC files for programming the CPLDs, PALs, etc.
> * Firmwares (e.g. EPROM, EEPROM, Flash ROM)
> * Amiga drivers (if necessary)
> 
> In other words: If a functional copy of your hardware cannot be made without having to buy components or software exclusively from you, you are not eligible for this repository.

**Can I still earn money with my project?**

> Of course! You can sell the complete hardware, construction kits, PCBs, preprogrammed chips etc. You can also ask for donations.
> 
> The only strict requirement is that anyone who is willing and able to build and run the hardware, will find all necessary resources in your project for free.

**I want to sell one part of the hardware or software. Can I still have a Product ID?**

> No. We're sorry, but this project is dedicated to promote Amiga hardware that is fully open. We can understand that you would like to have a financial compensation for the time you have invested in the project. However, for projects with a commercial aspect, it is still possible to quote an own Manufacturer ID from Hyperion.

## Manufacturer/Product ID

**What Manufacturer ID do you have?**

> Our manufacturer ID is 5194 (decimal).

**Is this an official ID?**

> **Yes!** The Manufacturer ID is officially registered with Hyperion Entertainment CVBA for exclusive use by this project. Your individual Product ID is assigned to you by us, and is valid for a lifetime.

**Can I ask for a specific Product ID?**

> Sure, unless it is already taken. We reserve the right to give you another Product ID though.

**Can I have multiple Product IDs for the same project?**

> Sure, if multiple Product IDs are technically required. You can also request further Product IDs later, if you extend your project and need more.
>
> However, you cannot reserve Product IDs for future use, since we request to see a photo of your working prototype. But there is also no need to do so, since it is easy to get more Product IDs as soon as you need them.

**Can I have a different Manufacturer ID?**

> Sure, but not from us. ðŸ˜‰ You can [obtain your own Manufacturer ID](https://wiki.amigaos.net/wiki/Amiga_Hardware_Manufacturer_ID_Registry) at Hyperion Entertainment CVBA. If your project complies to our rules for open Amiga hardware projects, you can still [apply to be listed here](application.md).

**boards.library does not show my name as manufacturer!**

> Yes, unfortunately the `boards.library` does not support diverging manufacturer names on product IDs. `identify.library` will show your name as manufacturer of your board though.

## Forks etc

**I have made a fork of an open Amiga hardware project. Can I get my own Product ID?**

> If it is just a fork, then no. You can still use the original product ID.
> 
> If your fork has evolved, and there are major changes to the original project that justify an own product ID, you can apply for one. Example: You forked an USB expansion, and added a SCSI host adapter to it.

**I want to continue developing on my project as closed source.**

> You can do so if your license permits it.
>
> However, your Product ID was assigned to the **open** version of your project. If you close it, you must register your own Manufacturer ID with Hyperion for the closed version.
