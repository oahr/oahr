# Application

You have made an open Amiga hardware project?

**Feel free to apply for being listed in this repository!**

It just takes a minute and is free of charge. The _Open Amiga Hardware Repository_ is run by Amiga enthusiasts.

**Our goal is to promote the development of open Amiga hardware.**

## The Rules

To get added to this repository, and get your own product IDs (if necessary), you need to comply with the following rules:

### 1. Open Source

All parts of your project (hardware, firmware, drivers, JEDEC files, documentation etc) must be publically available either under [Creative Commons](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/) or an [OSI](https://opensource.org/licenses/) approved open source license.

Of course you are still allowed to use and distribute your project commercially. However, the resources that you provide must be sufficient so anyone who wants to can build an own working copy of your project by themself.

Your project must be freely accessible to the public, with no obligation to register, subscribe, or pay access fees.

### 2. Prototype State

Your project must have reached at least a working prototype state. You must be able to show a working board (no experimental boards or rendered board images).

It is okay if there are still bugs, or if your board still needs a small number of botch wires and manual fixes, as long as you plan to get these issues corrected.

The reason for this rule is that we don't want to flood the repository with "useless" projects that might never leave their conceptional phase.

## Your Product ID

Amiga hardware expansions may need a _Manufacturer ID_ and _Product ID_ in order to be discovered on the Zorro bus. The _Manufacturer ID_ was assigned by Commodore, while the _Product ID_ is assigned by the manufacturer. Manufacturer IDs can still be obtained today, but it is tedious for hobbyists.

The _Open Amiga Hardware Repository_ has reserved its own _Manufacturer ID_, and is now assigning individual _Product IDs_ to open hardware projects, **simple and free of charge**! Your hardware product can get an official and unique _Product ID_ that is reserved for you for a lifetime. There is no need to use the prototype Manufacturer ID, or to waste time acquiring your own Manufacturer ID.

Just state in your application that you need one or more Product IDs.

As an additional benefit, your hardware will be automatically recognized by `boards.library` and `identify.library` with their next update.

## How To Apply

Please [open an issue](https://github.com/oahr/oahr/issues/new/choose) with this project. You will find a form there that you will need to fill out.

If we have further questions, we will follow up in that issue.

At the end, if everything went fine, your project will be listed in this repository, and you will get your Product IDs assigned.

## The Small Print

* Product IDs will be assigned on a "first-come, first-served" base. If there are conflicting applications, the creation date of the GitHub issue will be decisive.
* We reserve the right to refuse adding you to the repository, or assigning you a Product ID, without giving any reason.
* We do not permit to reserve Product IDs for "future use". Please only quote for Product IDs that you actually need for your current project. You can always come back later and request more Product IDs if you need them.
