<h2 id="open-hardware">Open Hardware<a class="headerlink" href="#open-hardware" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p><strong>What parts of the project must be open?</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Everything that is required for anyone to build and run a working copy of your hardware. This is (not limited):</p>
<ul>
<li>Circuit diagrams</li>
<li>Gerber files (to order the PCB at a PCB manufacturer)</li>
<li>JEDEC files for programming the CPLDs, PALs, etc.</li>
<li>Firmwares (e.g. EPROM, EEPROM, Flash ROM)</li>
<li>Amiga drivers (if necessary)</li>
</ul>
<p>In other words: If a functional copy of your hardware cannot be made without having to buy components or software exclusively from you, you are not eligible for this repository.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Can I still earn money with my project?</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Of course! You can sell the complete hardware, construction kits, PCBs, preprogrammed chips etc. You can also ask for donations.</p>
<p>The only strict requirement is that anyone who is willing and able to build and run the hardware, will find all necessary resources in your project for free.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>I want to sell one part of the hardware or software. Can I still have a Product ID?</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>No. We're sorry, but this project is dedicated to promote Amiga hardware that is fully open. We can understand that you would like to have a financial compensation for the time you have invested in the project. However, for projects with a commercial aspect, it is still possible to quote an own Manufacturer ID from Hyperion.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="manufacturerproduct-id">Manufacturer/Product ID<a class="headerlink" href="#manufacturerproduct-id" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p><strong>What Manufacturer ID do you have?</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our manufacturer ID is 5194 (decimal).</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Is this an official ID?</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Yes!</strong> The Manufacturer ID is officially registered with Hyperion Entertainment CVBA for exclusive use by this project. Your individual Product ID is assigned to you by us, and is valid for a lifetime.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Can I ask for a specific Product ID?</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sure, unless it is already taken. We reserve the right to give you another Product ID though.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Can I have multiple Product IDs for the same project?</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sure, if multiple Product IDs are technically required. You can also request further Product IDs later, if you extend your project and need more.</p>
<p>However, you cannot reserve Product IDs for future use, since we request to see a photo of your working prototype. But there is also no need to do so, since it is easy to get more Product IDs as soon as you need them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Can I have a different Manufacturer ID?</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sure, but not from us. ðŸ˜‰ You can <a href="https://wiki.amigaos.net/wiki/Amiga_Hardware_Manufacturer_ID_Registry">obtain your own Manufacturer ID</a> at Hyperion Entertainment CVBA. If your project complies to our rules for open Amiga hardware projects, you can still <a href="application.html">apply to be listed here</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>boards.library does not show my name as manufacturer!</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yes, unfortunately the <code>boards.library</code> does not support diverging manufacturer names on product IDs. <code>identify.library</code> will show your name as manufacturer of your board though.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="forks-etc">Forks etc<a class="headerlink" href="#forks-etc" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p><strong>I have made a fork of an open Amiga hardware project. Can I get my own Product ID?</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>If it is just a fork, then no. You can still use the original product ID.</p>
<p>If your fork has evolved, and there are major changes to the original project that justify an own product ID, you can apply for one. Example: You forked an USB expansion, and added a SCSI host adapter to it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>I want to continue developing on my project as closed source.</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>You can do so if your license permits it.</p>
<p>However, your Product ID was assigned to the <strong>open</strong> version of your project. If you close it, you must register your own Manufacturer ID with Hyperion for the closed version.</p>
