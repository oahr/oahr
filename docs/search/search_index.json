The Manufacturer ID was assigned by Commodore, while the Product ID is assigned by the manufacturer. Manufacturer IDs can still be requested today, but it is tedious for hobbyists. This is where the Open Amiga Hardware Repository comes into play. We have reserved our own Manufacturer ID , and are now assigning individual Product IDs to open hardware projects, simple and free of charge ! Your Benefits \u00b6 Your hardware product gets an official and unique Product ID that is reserved for you for a lifetime. There is no need to use the prototype ID, or to waste time acquiring your own manufacturer ID. All you have to do is to open a new issue and apply for it. Your hardware will be recognized by boards.library and identify.library with their next update automatically. The Rules \u00b6 The goal of this project is to promote open Amiga hardware projects . To get added to this repository, and get your own product IDs, you need to comply with the following rules: 1. Open Source \u00b6 All parts of your project (hardware, firmware, drivers, JEDEC files etc) must be publically available either under Creative Commons or an OSI approved open source license. Of course you are still allowed to use and distribute your project commercially. However, the resources that you provide must be sufficient so anyone who wants to can build an own working copy of your project by themself. 2. Prototype State \u00b6 Your project must have reached at least a working prototype state. You must be able to show a working board (no experimental boards or rendered images). It is okay if there are still bugs, or if your board still needs a small number of botch wires and manual fixes, as long as you plan to get these issues corrected. The reason for this rule is that the number of Product IDs are limited, so we don't want to use them on projects that might never leave their conceptional phase. How To Apply \u00b6 Please open an issue with this project. You will find a form there that you will need to fill out. If we have further questions, we will follow up in that issue. At the end, if everything went fine, your project will be listed in this repository, and you will get your Product IDs assigned. The Small Print \u00b6 Product IDs will be assigned on a \"first-come, first-served\" base. If there are conflicting applications, the creation date of the GitHub issue will be decisive. We reserve the right to refuse adding you to the repository, or assigning you a Product ID, without giving any reason.","title":"Application"},{"location":"application.html#application","text":"Amiga hardware expansions need a Manufacturer ID and Product ID in order to be discovered on the Zorro bus.

Everything that is required for anyone to build and run a working copy of your hardware. This is (not limited): Circuit diagrams Gerber files (to order the PCB at a PCB manufacturer) JEDEC files for programming the CPLDs, PALs, etc. Firmwares (e.g. EPROM, EEPROM, Flash ROM) Amiga drivers (if necessary) In other words: If a functional copy of your hardware cannot be made without having to buy components or software exclusively from you, you are not eligible for this repository. Can I still earn money with my project? Of course! You can sell the complete hardware, construction kits, PCBs, preprogrammed chips etc. You can also ask for donations. The only strict requirement is that anyone who is willing and able to build and run the hardware, will find all necessary resources in your project for free. I want to sell one part of the hardware or software. Can I still have a Product ID? No. We're sorry, but this project is dedicated to promote Amiga hardware that is fully open. We can understand that you would like to have a financial compensation for the time you have invested in the project. However, for projects with a commercial aspect, it is still possible to quote an own Manufacturer ID from Hyperion. Manufacturer/Product ID \u00b6 What Manufacturer ID do you have? Our manufacturer ID is 5194 (decimal). Is this an official ID? Yes! The Manufacturer ID is officially registered with Hyperion Entertainment CVBA for exclusive use by this project. Your individual Product ID is assigned to you by us, and is valid for a lifetime. Can I ask for a specific Product ID? Sure, unless it is already taken. We reserve the right to give you another Product ID though. Can I have multiple Product IDs for the same project? Sure, if multiple Product IDs are technically required. You can also request further Product IDs later, if you extend your project and need more. However, you cannot reserve Product IDs for future use, since we request to see a photo of your working prototype. But there is also no need to do so, since it is easy to get more Product IDs as soon as you need them. Can I have a different Manufacturer ID? Sure, but not from us. \ud83d\ude09 You can obtain your own Manufacturer ID at Hyperion Entertainment CVBA. If your project complies to our rules for open Amiga hardware projects, you can still apply to be listed here . boards.library does not show my name as manufacturer! Yes, unfortunately the boards.library does not support diverging manufacturer names on product IDs. identify.library will show your name as manufacturer of your board though. Forks etc \u00b6 I have made a fork of an open Amiga hardware project. Can I get my own Product ID? If it is just a fork, then no. You can still use the original product ID. If your fork has evolved, and there are major changes to the original project that justify an own product ID, you can apply for one. Example: You forked an USB expansion, and added a SCSI host adapter to it. I want to continue developing on my project as closed source. You can do so if your license permits it. However, your Product ID was assigned to the open version of your project. If you close it, you must register your own Manufacturer ID with Hyperion for the closed version.","title":"Frequently Asked Questions"},{"location":"faq.html#frequently-asked-questions","text":"","title":"Frequently Asked Questions"},{"location":"faq.html#open-hardware","text":"What parts of the project must be open?
